	<h2>Scenarios in TimeAlign</h2>
</div>

<p>
TimeAlign allows us to create so-called scenarios.
A scenario basically filters the fragments you would want to include into your analysis.
It works as follows:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<strong>Log in</strong> with your credentials in
	<a href="{% url 'admin:index' %}">the admin interface</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
	Click on the link "<strong>Scenarios</strong>".
	</li>
	<li>
	You will see an <strong>overview</strong> of the currently available
	scenarios. You can either <strong>edit</strong> an existing scenario (click on
	its title) or <strong>create</strong> a new one using the button "Add
	scenario" (top right). On the right, you can also <strong>filter</strong>
	the scenarios by corpus.
	</li>
	<li>
	When adding or editing a scenario, you first supply a proper <strong>title</strong>,
	a <strong>description</strong> (as clear as possible, so others know what it's
	about) and check whether this is (or isn't) a <strong>test</strong>
	scenario. Then click "<strong>Save and continue editing</strong>".
	</li>
    <li>
	This button will <strong>update</strong> the "Documents" selection box
	with documents only for this Corpus. If you want, you can now <strong>select</strong>
	the <strong>documents</strong> that you want to use ("1.xml" → Chapter
	1). Leave this empty to include all documents.
	</li>
    <li>
	Next, you can select (if your Corpus has annotations for that) for
	which <strong>formal structure</strong> (narration, dialogue or "none",
	which means both narration and dialogue) you want to create maps,
	and if you want to require translations to be in the same formal
	structure.
    </li>
    <li>
	Next, you'll see a link allowing you to show Multidimensional
	Scaling options. If you want to be really scrupulous, you can <strong>set
	the number of dimensions</strong> to be used in the multidimensional
	scaling algorithm. It's 5 by default, but in some situations fewer
	dimensions will also return good results (i.e. the solution has a
	low stress value (&lt;20), which means a high goodness-of-fit; the
	idea is basically that the optimal number of dimensions is where the
	stress doesn't go down a lot anymore when you add another
	dimension; see <a href="http://www.analytictech.com/networks/mds.htm">this
	page</a> for some explanation). If you tick the box for
	"<strong>Allow partial tuples in model</strong>", you will generate
	results on all the data in your sample, not just those data points
	with annotated translations in all languages in your sample.
	</li>
    <li>
	Next, you will have to <strong>supply the original languages</strong> for this
	scenario. First, select the language(s) your original fragments are
	in, and click the "as from" checkbox to signal this as a
	"from"-language. Again, click "Save and continue editing".
	</li>
    <li>
	This button will update the form with tenses and labels that are relevant
      for this language.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you use tenses in your corpus, you may now <strong>select the
	tenses</strong> you would like to include in the scenario. Leave this empty to include all
	tenses.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you use labels in your corpus, make sure to check the "use labels" checkbox.
      You may now choose to configure the "Include keys" and "Filter by labels" fields:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Choosing keys under "Include keys" will affect the components used in the scenario data points. For example, suppose fragments in your corpus were annotated with two different keys, but you wish to only use one of them in the scenario, then you should select only one key in this form field. This will not cause any annotations to be filtered out, but each annotation will be treated as having a single label.
        </li>
        <li>
          Choosing labels under "Filter by labels" will cause only annotations that were assigned one of the selected labels to be included in the scenario. This will have no effect on the components used in the scenario data points.
        </li>
        <li>For both fields, making no selection implies including everything.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
	Next, you have to <strong>supply the translated languages</strong> for this
	scenario. First, select the language(s) your translated fragments
	are in, and click the "as to" checkbox to signal this as a
	"to"-language. Again, click "Save and continue editing".
	</li>
        <li>
	This button will again update the "Tenses" selection box and label fields.
	</li>
    <li>
	<strong>Repeat steps 8-12 for every language</strong> in your scenario. If
	you're finished, again click "<strong>Save and continue editing</strong>".
	</li>
    <li>
	Then, click "<strong>(Re)run Multidimensional Scaling</strong>" to run the
	multidimensional scaling algorithm.
	</li>
    <li>
	After completion, you will now be able to <strong>see the results</strong> in
	the application if you navigate to
        <a href="{% url 'stats:scenarios' %}">"Translation Mining → Results"</a>.
	Be sure to use the <strong>filter</strong> all the way down to include test
	scenarios if your scenario happens to be a test scenario.
	</li>
    <li>
	If the map doesn't look quite right, you can <strong>retry</strong> by
	clicking the "(Re)run Multidimensional Scaling" button again. If
	you want, you can also limit the number of dimensions used by
	editing the "Number of dimensions" field hidden under the
	Multidimensional Scaling bar (see step 7 above).
</ol>

<p>
	Apart from (of course) the
	<a href="{% url 'stats:mds' scenario.pk %}">Multidimensional Scaling visualization</a>,
	running the algorithm opens up a wide range of other possible analyses:

	</li>
	<li>
