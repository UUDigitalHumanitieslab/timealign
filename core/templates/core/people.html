    The Time in Translation pilot project is carried out by researchers from the <a href="http://www.uu.nl/onderzoek/utrecht-institute-of-linguistics-ots" target="_blank">Utrecht Institute of Linguistics OTS</a>
    and programmers from the <a href="http://dig.hum.uu.nl/" target="_blank">Utrecht Digital Humanities Lab</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Main applicant <a href="http://www.uu.nl/staff/HEdeSwart" target="_blank">Prof. Dr. Henriëtte de Swart</a> (PhD 1991, Groningen, cum laude) is an expert on cross-linguistic semantics, with particular expertise in the domain of negation, (in)definiteness, tense and aspect. She has earned a solid reputation for caring about detailed natural language data, collected using native speaker intuitions, database construction, corpus research, and psycholinguistic experimentation. With Petra Hendriks and Helen de Hoop, she developed bidirectional Optimality Theory as a framework to analyze cross-linguistic variation at the syntax-semantics interface. She has extensive experience in directing research projects and supervising PhDs and Post-Docs: 17 PhD students graduated under her supervision so far, and she supervised 3 Post-Docs. She is currently project leader of the NWO funded UiL OTS Graduate Programme in Linguistics (5 PhD students, 2009-2015). She is head of the French BA/MA programme and coordinator of the UU Research Master Linguistics. She is director of LOT, the Netherlands Graduate School of Linguistics, and as such responsible for the curricular training of PhD students in linguistics in the Netherlands. She currently serves on the editorial board of Linguistics and Philosophy, Semantics and Pragmatics, Language and Linguistic Compass, and Catalan Journal of Linguistics. She is an associate editor of Natural Language and Linguistic Theory.

    Co-applicant <a href="http://www.uu.nl/staff/BSWLeBruyn" target="_blank">dr. Bert Le Bruyn</a> (PhD 2010, Utrecht) is an expert on semantic language variation with a solid background in corpus linguistics (monolingual synchronic/diachronic corpora, multilingual comparable/parallel corpora, and L2 learner corpora). His joint research with Julia Pozas-Loyo (Colegio de Mexico) bears on the diachronic development of French des and Spanish unos. His insights on referentiality and HAVE are developed in collaboration with Henriëtte de Swart and Joost Zwarts (UU), Atle Gronn (Oslo University) and Christina Marzhauser (Munich University). Next to his Master’s in general linguistics (2005, Utrecht) he holds a Master’s in Romance linguistics, with a specialization in French and Spanish (2003, Antwerp). He obtained the Segundo Premio Carlos Quinto from the Fundación Duques de Soria (2001) for outstanding students in Spanish. He’s currently working on his VENI-project focusing on the semantics and L2 acquisition of referentiality. In this project, he uses both corpus and experimental techniques to bridge the gap between formal linguistics, acquisition and education. He is guest editor of a Lingua special issue on the interplay between formal syntax/semantics and typology of possession (expected 2016).

    Both the main and co-applicant are actively bringing together corpus and theoretical linguists. De Swart co-organized the KNAW colloquium ‘Language Variation in Action’ (17-19 February 2016) and Le Bruyn is co-organizing the workshop ‘Learner Corpus based approaches to Second Language Acquisition’ (31 March-1 April 2017). They are also actively involved in promoting modern language education. De Swart is a member of the KNAW committee ‘Talen in Nederland – Talen voor Nederland’ and Le Bruyn is a member of the Meesterschapsteam Moderne Vreemde Talen.
